I've been gone for so long now
Chasing everything that's new
And I've forgotten how I got here
But I've not forgotten you
We were just children with our eyes opened and
You were all that I could see
You came close enough to know my heart beat but
Still not close enough for me

Through the good times and the bad
You were the best I never had
The only chance
I wish I had to take
There was no writing on the wall
No warning signs to follow
I know now and I just can't forget
You're the best I never had

Nanana

In this motel
Well past midnight
When I'm bluer than a bruise
And you come drifting in through the half light
In your funny yellow shoes
And I hope that's you standing at my doorway
That's the scratching of your key
And I hope this song I'm singing
Someday finds you
My letter to release

Through the good times and the bad
You were the best I never had
The only chance I wish I had to take
There was no writing on the wall
No warning signs to follow
I know now and I just can't forget
You're the best I never had
Nana nanana
Best I never had
Nana Nanana mmmm
Best I never had
Nana Nanana
